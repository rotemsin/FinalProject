In this heuristic, the favourite team
will play against 3 random teams in
the group stage, with no relation to 
the odds in the probability matrix.
If the favourite team goes through to
the knockout stage it will continue 
to play teams randomly. This 
heuristic is used as a test case to
compare to all other heuristics.
