In this heuristic the favourite team 
will play the 3 teams it is most 
likely to lose to in the group stage, 
Later on, it will continue to face
teams it is unlikely to beat 
throughout the tournament. The 
thought behind this heuristic is that
if the favourite team manages to beat
the "stronger" teams early in the 
tournament it can succeed later on.
